This project explores the use of Graph Attention Networks (GATs) for detecting money laundering activities in financial transaction networks. Traditional AML detection methods struggle to capture complex transaction patterns, making them ineffective against sophisticated laundering schemes. Our approach represents financial transactions as graphs, where entities are nodes and transactions are edges, enabling a more structured analysis.

Key Highlights
âœ… GAT-Based Model â€“ Leverages graph structures to uncover illicit financial activities.
âœ… Public Dataset â€“ Uses real-world financial transaction data for validation.
âœ… High Accuracy â€“ Outperforms traditional ML models in detecting suspicious transactions.
âœ… Graph-Based Features â€“ Captures intricate transaction relationships beyond standard tabular models.

Technologies & Tools
ðŸ“Œ Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
ðŸ“Œ PyTorch Geometric
ðŸ“Œ Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn
ðŸ“Œ Matplotlib, Seaborn

Results
ðŸ“Š Our model achieved an 87% accuracy, significantly improving AML detection.

ðŸš€ Future Work: Scaling GNNs for real-time detection, integrating hybrid ML techniques, and expanding dataset diversity.
